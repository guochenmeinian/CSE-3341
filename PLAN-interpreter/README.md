# PLAN Interpreter Project

This subdirectory contains the PLAN Interpreter project for CSE 3341, focused on implementing an interpreter for the PLAN language using Scheme.

## Overview

The PLAN Interpreter is a simpler project compared to the CORE Interpreter. It involves writing an interpreter for PLAN, a simple functional language, using Scheme programming concepts and dynamic scoping.

## Language Grammar

The PLAN language is defined by a concise grammar, primarily focusing on basic arithmetic operations, conditional expressions, and variable bindings.

## Implementation

The core of the project is the `myinterpreter` function in Scheme, which evaluates PLAN programs according to the specified grammar and rules.

## Testing

Testing is performed using provided test cases and a command-line script, ensuring the interpreter's functionality and correctness.

This project serves as an introductory exploration into functional programming and language interpretation in Scheme.

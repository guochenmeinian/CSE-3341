# CSE 3341 - Principles of Programming Languages

This repository contains materials for the CSE 3341 course at Ohio State University, focusing on the principles of programming languages. It includes lecture slides, review materials, and projects developed as part of the course curriculum.

## Structure

- `reviews/`: Contains review documents and notes that summarize key concepts and topics discussed in the course.
- `slides/`: Lecture slides that cover various topics in compiler design and construction, providing a comprehensive overview of the course content.
- `CORE-intepreter`: Houses all materials, source code, and documentation for the CORE Interpreter project, a relatively complex Java implementation comprising five labs.
- `PLAN-intepreter/`: Contains materials for the PLAN Interpreter project, a very simple functional language implemented in Scheme. This project has only one lab and is relatively straightforward compared to the CORE Interpreter.

## Projects Overview

### CORE Interpreter Project

A multi-lab project in Java exploring compiler design for the CORE language. It includes a scanner, parser, interpreter, function calls handling, and garbage collection.

### PLAN Interpreter Project

A simpler project in Scheme, focusing on interpreting a functional language called PLAN. It's a concise introduction to functional programming concepts.
